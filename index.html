            <label for="first">What is Netflix?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that offers a large library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and anime on a variety of internet-connected devices. Subscribers pay a monthly fee for unlimited, ad-free access to the content, which is renewed weekly with new content being added. </p>

            <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="Fifth">
            <label for="Fifth">What can i watch on netflix?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>You can watch trending shows like Frankenstein and The Witcher, popular movies like Jolly LLB 3 and KPop Demon Hunters, or critically acclaimed titles like Squid Game and Wednesday. Netflix offers a wide variety of content including TV shows, movies, anime, and documentaries that can be streamed on many internet-connected devices. </p>

            <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="sixth">
            <label for="sixth">Is netflix good for kids?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Netflix can be good for kids, especially with the "Netflix Kids" profile, but parents must actively use the available parental controls to ensure safety. The platform has a vast library with a mix of content, so without proper setup, children could access age-inappropriate material like graphic violence or adult themes. By creating a kids' profile, filtering content by maturity ratings, and locking profiles with a PIN, parents can create a safe and curated viewing experience. </p>
